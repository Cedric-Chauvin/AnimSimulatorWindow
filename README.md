# AnimSimulatorWindow

Hello, thanks to download my animation Simulator window!
The window is still in work in progress because it need more reflection to support all types of blend tree.
But you can :  
-Select an Animator in the scene  
-Select an Animation or a blend tree in the animator  
-If a blend tree is selected a slider appear to control the used parameter in the animator  
-Play,Pause and Stop the animation in the scene without playing the game  
-Setup some parameter like: loop the animation, play in place and the play rate  
-See the animation progression in the slider and interact with it to see a particular time  

You can email me at: Cedric.chauvin99@gmail.com if you have questions.
Good Test!
